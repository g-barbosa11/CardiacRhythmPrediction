# CardiacRhythmPrediction

In a healthcare rehabilitation center, sensors are installed to determine the quality of its environmental conditions. It is necessary to have control of the air quality and other parameters related to the environment, to act quickly if anomalies are detected, which can be very harmful to patients.Sensors are installed in various locations such as: waiting room, bedrooms, bathrooms, cafeteria, activity room, office, garden. Acceptable levels of measured data can vary depending on the location of the meter.

There are also wristbands that measure heart rate, these are placed on patients with heart diseases or risks. The goal is to be able to control and perform early interventions on patients who have changes in these values. In the office, a server is available for monitoring the measured parameters, making their levels available in real time.
